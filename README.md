# RestAssured API Automation Framework

This framework leverages **RestAssured** for automating RESTful API testing, with a focus on modularity, **data-driven testing**, and **continuous integration**. Built on **TestNG and Maven**, it ensures smooth test execution and reporting, integrated with **Git** and **Jenkins** for seamless CI/CD.


## Key Features


- Endpoint Testing: Cover API domains with modular payloads (POJOs) for request body management.
- Data-Driven Testing: Utilizes external Excel/JSON files for flexible and scalable test cases.
- Utility Functions: Reusable utilities for handling requests, responses, and data extraction, ensuring DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Custom Reports: Detailed reports via ExtentReports for visualizing test outcomes with pass/fail status and logs.
- CI Integration: Integrated with Jenkins for continuous testing on every code push using Git.

## Conclusion

This **RestAssured API Automation Framework** offers a robust solution for testing RESTful APIs. Its modular structure, coupled with data-driven testing and CI integration, makes it highly scalable, maintainable, and efficient for real-world API automation testing.
